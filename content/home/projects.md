  description = """When evaluating diagnostic imaging tests, the multi-reader, multi-case free response study design is typically used, which gives rise to cross-correlated data structure. The existing methods cannot fully address this issue and ignore the effects of addition covariates on accuracy estimates as well.
  Responsibilities include:
  
  * Proposed a marginal regression model for the area under the alternative FROC curves (AFROC-AUC)
  * Derived covariate-adjusted AFROC-AUC to summarize the overall accuracy of a diagnostic test while taking the covariates information into consideration
  * Conducted simulation studies and real example analysis to verify the performance of the new method
  * Compiled the approach, simulation, and real example results into a manuscript for submission
  * Wrote a tutorial article on the evaluation of imaging tests in collaboration with other researchers
