  description = """When evaluating diagnostic imaging tests, the multi-reader, multi-case free response study design is typically used, which gives rise to cross-correlated data structure. The existing methods cannot fully address this issue and ignore the effects of addition covariates on accuracy estimates as well.
  
  Responsibilities include:
  
  * Proposed a marginal regression model for the area under the alternative FROC curves (AFROC-AUC)
  * Derived covariate-adjusted AFROC-AUC to summarize the overall accuracy of a diagnostic test while taking the covariates information into consideration
  * Conducted simulation studies and real example analysis to verify the performance of the new method
  * Compiled the approach, simulation, and real example results into a manuscript for submission
  * Wrote a tutorial article on the evaluation of imaging tests in collaboration with other researchers

  description = """When the reference test is imperfect and is only given to a non-random subgroup, imperfect gold standard bias and verification bias could arise, leading to biased estimates of the sensitivity and specificity. The existing Bayesian method is sensitive to prior distribution and is less efficient.
  
  Responsibilities include:
  
  * Developed a maximum likelihood procedure for simultaneous correcting both verification bias and imperfect gold standard bias in collaboration with Lu Wang
  * Implemented the novel approach to the COVID-19 example and derived unbiased accuracy estimates of chest CT and RT-PCR for detecting COVID-19
  * Wrote both the methods and the results sections of the article and submitted the work for publication
