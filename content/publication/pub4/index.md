abstract: Conventional receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis provides an overall performance measure, which regards the whole case as the "diagnostic unit". However, in diagnostic imaging studies, there can be multiple "diagnostic units" in one case and some of them are true lesions. In this paper, we reviewed several extensions of conventional ROC method---Free response ROC, Localization ROC and region of interest (ROI) analysis, different types of location-specific method dealing with both detection and localization of lesions. We detailed their concepts and corresponding statistical methods for calculating the figure of merit (FOM). Although these three diagrams can partially resolve the two cancelling errors introduced by ROC analysis, they have different defects and limitations, We think that researchers need to figure out the authentic research questions and choose proper method. We also apply these different location-specific analysis method to a real data and compare the pros and cons. In addition, available software and database for the analysis of FROC, LROC and ROI data are provided.
