abstract: In this article, we develop a novel maximum likelihood method for simultaneously correcting both imperfect gold standard and verification bias in estimating the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests. Our method treats the sensitivity and specificity as unknown parameters and modelling the verification probabilities in a maximum likelihood procedure. The imperfect gold standard and/or verification bias are frequently ignored in the previous studies for evaluating the accuracy of chest CT and RT-PCR tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and to the best of our knowledge, no appropriate method has been adopted to correct these two types of bias. Our proposed method produces unbiased estimates for the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 tests, which could be an important clinically relevant reference.
